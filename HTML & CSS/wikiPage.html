    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>

    <p>
        The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America.In North
        America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears, while the subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak
        Islands of Alaska is known as the Kodiak bear. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order
        Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less
        variable in size and slightly bigger on average.
